<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Burak Tamt√ºrk, I study English Translation and Interpreting in Turkey, I am interested in reserve engineering, system administration, clustering and programming but specially at reserve engineering, security and journalism. </p>
<p>I'll keep my blog simple. I prefer call KeStackAttachProcess to switch to other nice blogs address space and stole their css, or even better, map their css to my blog's css.</p>
